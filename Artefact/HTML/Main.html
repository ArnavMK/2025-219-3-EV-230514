                        <br>
                        A low UR, high ER and a low OOSR suggests that the country has a high quality of education, as it is able to keep
                        up with demand of education. High employment suggests the education system is capable of producing skilled labour force attracting
                        foreign investment and economic growth. Although this comes with incredibly high competition and hence poor work life balance. If a country
                        follows this trend, then it may be good if you want study there.

                        then countries with an average trend in those figures will be good options if you are looking to study in an environment with enough competition without being overwhelmingly intense.
                        Theses trends suggests that their education system is growing steadily (high ER), providing good opportunities while still
                        having enough competition. A stable UR proves that these countries are in demand for foreign investment.
