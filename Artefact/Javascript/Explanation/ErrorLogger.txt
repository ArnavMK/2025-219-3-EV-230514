
NAME: ErrorLogger
TYPE: ES6 class (JS)
FUNCTION: to log any error message onto an error logger element provided on construction (styled as per user)

METHODS: 
 
1. ShowNewError(errorMessage): the only public method that initiates the coroutine (a state machine) for a basic error logger.
   When called it sets the opacity of the loggerElement to 1 (assuming css has the animation covered) and displays the message.
   Although if the user creates many errors in a certain amount of time (5s) it causes problems with the visuals on the front end
   Hence a Map (errorList) and a boolean variable (isFree) were implemented to act as a queue to store the errors one after the other.
   
2. HideErrorLogger(errorMessage): a private method called by the above method after it sets the logger's opacity. (called after 5s).
   It deletes the error previously in the logger from the errorList (via the parameter). If there are any more errors left it repeats the cycle by 
   calling the above method after a cool down of 402ms to give enough time for the animation (if any).
 
Using a Map automatically filters any duplicate errors that the user might cause, so same errors will only show up once for 5s
